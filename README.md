# OpenBCI_GUI
Based on OpenBCI_Processing, OpenBCI_GUI_v2.0 extends the GUI to include additional features, and interfaces with the OpenBCI [Cyton](http://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/openbci-32-bit-board-kit?variant=784651699) and [Ganglion](http://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/pre-order-ganglion-board?variant=13461804483) hardware systems. Tutorials, and getting started guides can be found on the [OpenBCI Learning Pages](http://docs.openbci.com/Getting%20Started/00-Welcome). For a guide on how to run this code in the Processing IDE, go [to our great docs](http://docs.openbci.com/OpenBCI%20Software/01-OpenBCI_GUI).

# IMPORTANT: GANGLION USERS

Please follow these instructions for getting the **critical** piece of software called the Ganglion HUB [Mac/Linux](http://docs.openbci.com/OpenBCI%20Software/01-OpenBCI_GUI#the-openbci-gui-install-ganglion-hub-on-mac) [Windows](http://docs.openbci.com/OpenBCI%20Software/01-OpenBCI_GUI#the-openbci-gui-install-ganglion-hub-on-windows). Thanks and happy hacking!

# Widgets

There are strict simple rules to ad hear to for your wonderful widget to "magically" be populated in the drop down list on the GUI. Remember always be a hear! Fork the repo (if you know git) add your widget and open a pull request. Always browse the issues page for possible widgets to make!

Use the [widget template](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_GUI/blob/master/OpenBCI_GUI/W_Template.pde) to get started and check out all the other cool widgets for examples on how to make one. You rock!

# Troubleshooting
If you find your self saying:
_When I run the OpenBCI UI from Processing on my Mac I don’t see the Ganglion_
_But from the OpenBCI App (real one, not from the code), it works._
_I feel like I need to authorize Processing to use Bluetooth… it that makes any sense at all_
